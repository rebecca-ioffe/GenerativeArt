# Generative Art

### [Link to Shiny App](https://rebeccaioffe.shinyapps.io/practice_activity/)

## Description
This project consists of two plots that use generative functions to create art. One plot is a segment plot, while the other utilizes the `ambient` package to layer "noise" from generated number sequences.

## Code Breakdown

### Plot 1: Segment Plot
I used the **Iris dataset** in base R to create a segment plot. The segments are color-coded based on the species, with the `shade` argument specifying the color palette. The following variables are included:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

I adjusted the width of the segments, using **Petal Width** as the length of each segment. For visual appeal, I added semi-transparent yellow points at the end of each segment. The plot was finalized with a formatted background, title, description, and caption.

### Plot 2: Noise-Generated Art
This plot uses the `ggthemes` package to randomly generate color palettes based on a seed number input by the user, utilizing the `sample_canva()` function.

Hereâ€™s the process to create the plot:

1. I generated a **1000 x 1000 grid** by creating two sequences of random numbers from 1 to 10, each of length 1000.
2. The `long_grid()` function was used to form an x-y grid from these points, creating the "canvas."
3. I applied noise generators from the **ambient** package to this grid:
   - `gen_perlin()` with a frequency of 0.9, producing large, low-frequency Perlin shapes.
   - `gen_waves()` with a frequency of 5, creating more frequent wave patterns.
   - `gen_spheres()` with a frequency of 25, producing many small spheres, then normalized using the `normalize()` function to ensure values are between 0 and 1.
4. These noise patterns were combined using the `paint()` function, conditioned on the values of the generated spheres.
5. I created a **raster plot** using a custom color palette generated by `sample_canva()` with a seed of 54, and formatted the plot with customized axes, scale, and title.
